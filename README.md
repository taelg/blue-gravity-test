# blue-gravity-test
Test from Natanael Galli

The system has a character who is able to change cloths easily by assigning a cloth asset.
It also contains an NPC that is able to interact with the character and change their hair, hair color, cloths and hats.
The pricing part isn't done because I didn't have enough time, so I did choose to code the hair color over the pricing.

I've had a lot of fun during the process of creating this small demo.
My main difficult was making some code architecture decisions when I didn't know the big picture of the game, but just a slice of it.
I also had difficult with time, I started the project thinking a lot of scalability and maintainability 
and I think It took to long for me to realize I had to hurry up because it was a bigger challenge than I expected (in terms of time).

For my personal assessment I think my performance was good under the conditions of the test, 
but I also know I can deliver a lot more quality if I have more time, 
even because I already have a huge list of adjustments, improvements and fixes I thought for this small demo already.

Thanks for inviting me ^^
